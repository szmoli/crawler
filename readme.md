# Summary

Crawler is a simple dungeon crawler game project. I've started this project for two main reasons. Firstly I wanted to practice programming in C because I really like the language but we don't use it for anything in Uni anymore. Secondly I wanted to learn basic concepts behind games and the basic linear algebra behind them. The goal is to write everything myself so I understand everything throughly.

# Building and running

I have provided a Makefile in the project's root folder. You can build the project with the `make build` command assuming you have `gcc` installed, then you can run the program with the `make run` command. You can use the `make clean` command to clear the `out` directory.
